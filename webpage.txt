C
ron jobs are piece of code which executes automatically after a certain period of time in simple words.

They use time based job scheduler known as cron. The schedule is defined by a cron expression, which specifies when the task should run.

Expression :

* * * * *  
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +-- Day of the Week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
| | | +---- Month (1 - 12) (January to December)
| | +------ Day of the Month (1 - 31)
| +-------- Hour (0 - 23)
+---------- Minute (0 - 59)

Cron expressions allow the use of special characters to create more flexible schedules.

Comma(,)

The comma , is used to specify a list of values for a field. It allows you to define multiple values in one field.

Eg : 5,10,15 * * * * means the task will run at minute 5, 10, and 15 of every hour.

2. Hyphen(-)

The hyphen - specifies a range of values.

Example: 1-5 * * * * means the task will run every day at hours 1 through 5 (i.e., 1:00, 2:00, ..., 5:00).

3. Slash(/)

The slash / is used to specify step values. It tells the cron job to run at intervals within the specified range.

Example: */5 * * * * means the task will run every 5 minutes.

4. Question Mark (?)

The question mark ? is used in some systems (like Quartz Scheduler) in place of an asterisk to indicate "no specific value" for day-of-month or day-of-week fields.

Example: 0 0 1 * ? means "run at midnight on the first day of every month," with no specific day of the week.

Now lest implement cron jobs on node js :

Install packages

npm install node-cron

Create a file app.js

const cron = require('node-cron');

cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
  console.log('Task runs every minute');
});

This file will schedule a cron job which will run automatically after every minute.

Run the app

node app.js

Now lets see how we use cron job on application server deployed on vercel .

Starter commands :

mkdir node-cron-example
cd node-cron-example
npm init -y
npm i express node-cron

Create index.js :

const express = require('express');
const cron = require('node-cron');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Server is healthy');
});

app.get('/cron', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Cron job triggered manually');
  res.status(200).send('Cron job was triggered');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

Create vercel.json file :

{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      {
        "src": "index.js",
        "use": "@vercel/node",
        "config": { "includeFiles": ["dist/**"] }
      }
    ],
    "routes": [
      {
        "src": "/(.*)",
        "dest": "index.js"
      }
    ],
    "crons": [
      {
        "path": "/api/cron",
        "schedule": "0 0 1 * *"
      }
    ]
  }

Note : Hobby account on vercel limits your cron job to only run twice a day .

Now you can deploy this server on vercel by creating a new git repo and importing it on vercel and click deploy .
